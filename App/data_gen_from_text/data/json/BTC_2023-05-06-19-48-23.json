    "Question": "How are transactions validated and added to the blockchain?",
    "Answer": "Network nodes running bitcoin software validate transactions, add them to their copy of the ledger, and then broadcast these ledger additions to other nodes. Each network node stores its own copy of the blockchain to achieve independent verification of the chain of ownership. At varying intervals of time averaging to every 10 minutes, a new group of accepted transactions, called a block, is created, added to the blockchain, and quickly published to all nodes, without requiring central oversight."

    "Question": "What are transaction fees in the bitcoin system?",
    "Answer": "Transaction fees are optional in the bitcoin system, but miners can choose which transactions to process and prioritize those that pay higher fees. These fees are generally measured in satoshis per byte and are dependent on the size of transactions, which is determined by the number of inputs used to create the transaction and the number of outputs. Miners may choose transactions based on the fee paid relative to their storage size, not the absolute amount of money paid as a fee."
