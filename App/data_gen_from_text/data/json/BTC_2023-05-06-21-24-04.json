{  "Question_ID":"1",  "Question": "What is required to create a bitcoin address?",  "Answer": "Creating a bitcoin address requires nothing more than picking a random valid private key and computing the corresponding bitcoin address. This computation can be done in a split second."},{  "Question_ID":"2",  "Question": "What happens if the private key of a bitcoin address is lost?",  "Answer": "If the private key is lost, the bitcoin network will not recognize any other evidence of ownership, and the coins are then unusable and effectively lost. About 20% of all bitcoins are believed to be lost, which would have had a market value of about $20 billion at July 2018 prices."},{  "Question_ID":"3",  "Question": "What is the proof-of-work system in bitcoin mining?",  "Answer": "The proof-of-work system requires miners to find a number called a nonce, such that when the block content is hashed along with the nonce, the result is numerically smaller than the network's difficulty target. This PoW is easy for any node in the network to verify, but extremely time-consuming to generate. By adjusting this difficulty target, the amount of work needed to generate a block can be changed."},{  "Question_ID":"4",  "Question": "What is the purpose of mining in the bitcoin network?",  "Answer": "Mining is a record-keeping service done through the use of computer processing power. Miners keep the blockchain consistent, complete, and unalterable by repeatedly grouping newly broadcast transactions into a block, which is then broadcast to the network and verified by recipient nodes. Each block contains a SHA-256 cryptographic hash of the previous block, thus linking it to the previous block and giving the blockchain its name."},{  "Question_ID":"5",  "Question": "What is the ownership distribution of bitcoins?",  "Answer": "As of 28 December 2022, 9.62% of bitcoin addresses own 98.51% of all bitcoins ever mined. The largest of these addresses are thought to belong to exchanges, which are keeping their bitcoin in cold storage."}
