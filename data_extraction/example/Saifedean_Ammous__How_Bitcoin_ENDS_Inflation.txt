say if you you did propose a way that Bitcoin could kind of prevent a hyperinflation or at least make the transition more peaceful which is something that I really liked and you said Bitcoin could be like someone skillfully dismantling the Fiat House of Cards into a deck of cards by removing each set of two cards leaning on each other at the same time the card of Fiat demand and the card of Fiat Supply that's how you take down the House of Cards that's how you prevent it from crashing down and I would love it if you just kind of expand on that because I think it's kind of hopeful that Bitcoin could kind of operate alongside Fiat and actually help kind of slowly dismantle it instead of this kind of more doomsday crash scenario yeah I think um when I as I was saying earlier about the kind of difficulty adjustment in Fiat so as I was kind of concluding the book I realized like this can go on and it's going to continue to devalue you know you're not going to get hyper inflation but the money supply you know the money is going to continue to lose value as it is designed to do uh you can argue about you know one percent two percent three percent five six seven eight we're arguing numbers here but ultimately nobody disagrees that the money is losing value and on the other hand Bitcoin has number go up technology wherein the money is gaining value so you know you can keep extrapolating this it might be a year or 10 or 100 ultimately that Dynamic I think because of just the scarcity of Bitcoin and the um profligacy of the creation of the Fiat money is going to likely continue for a while and I think as long as you have this Dynamic wherein credit is being created in that way and destroyed in that way you're not going to get these massive hyperinflationary collapses of Fiat money but you're just going to witness the Fiat economy um grow less and less as a percentage of the global economy which is if you think of Bitcoin as a global economy you know it's been increasing as a percentage of the global economy over the last 14 years if extrapolate that further nobody really has a magic ball to tell how quick how fast and how often we get there how fast we get there but you know depends on how much communication you have how much destruction you have but if you were to look at the past 60 years you know there's no reason why it can't go on for the another 60 years perhaps wherein you have in these kind of well-run relatively uh countries um seven eight nine percent per year uh increase the money supply and then over time you know the value of that economy continues to decline whereas the value of the Bitcoin economy continues to grow because people who put wealth and Bitcoin Witnesses appreciating in real terms because the supply is only increasing very little so over time effectively um you know there's no need for this to be any kind of uh uh cataclysmic event there's just in in the same way that uh computers took over market share from typewriters you know people continue to use typewriters and people started using computers and over time more and more people realized yeah no I could just get myself a computer and a printer or you know sometimes not even a printer but over time you know the typewriter industry kind of went out of business and the computer industry grew to become much larger it wasn't cataclysmic you know some people lost some money in typewriter businesses but generally if you're a capitalist in a typewriter uh you know investing in a typewriter company you're taking on risk so it's generally this is how the market handles disruption you know slowly over time um the people who are into typewriting whether they're typewriters or producers of typewriting or people who buy those things one by one they make their way to the new economy and eventually they benefit from the increase in productivity and I think we could see something similar with uh Bitcoin and Fiat the Fiat economy becomes progressively a smaller thing as the Bitcoin economy continues to grow if you accept you know the premise that uh Bitcoin continues to grow obviously um but if you do then it is possible that this happens I think there's no reason why Bitcoin would cause hyperinflation because I think um you know remember earlier in the book I was saying the way that Fiat Minds Fiat creates money Fiat mining happens is through the creation of credit and so therefore um when people start using Bitcoin as a form of saving they become less likely to take out credit and perhaps more importantly they become less likely to buy credit instruments as a form of saving in other words buying bonds so Bitcoin decreases the supply of Fiat as well as decreasing the demand for Fiat so people think oh everyone's going to dump their dollars and buy Bitcoin and the price of Bitcoin is going to go to the moon and the price of the dollar is going to go to zero well nobody really has any dollars I mean obviously a lot of people have a lot of dollars there's a ton of dollars out there and they're always making more but really the people who have significant wealth have negative Fiat balances you know so the richest people in the world you know Jeff Bezos doesn't have 120 billion dollars of cash or whatever it is sitting in a vault somewhere um in Amazon headquarters he's got stocks and credit instruments um he doesn't have liquid cash and so if Jeff Bezos was to get rid of his dollars because he's afraid of hyperinflation yeah I'm sure he'll sell several million maybe even billions who knows I doubt he's got a billion in cash but he'll sell some of that so that would you know decrease the demand for dollars in a sense but most likely he's got a tiny fraction in dollars most likely what he's going to sell you know serious money the rich people and the institutions that have the vast majority of money they don't hold it in cash they hold debt and so if they shift to bitcoin they drop their bonds they drop their dollar denominated bonds and hold Bitcoin that is far more economically significant than them dropping their checking account balances because you could be a billionaire in your checking account is like I don't know I'm not a bidding them myself so I wouldn't even know but you know it could be a few million dollars which is relatively insignificant compared to the more serious amount of assets you would have in bonds and so if these billionaires and large asset owners and large asset allocators and financial institutions and institutional investors and Sovereign wealth funds and so on if these people start shifting away from holding you know if we do witness a shift away from dollars to bitcoin it's not going to be most significant that they're shifting out their checking account it's going to be far more significant they're shifting out there um debt Holdings and so they are reducing the creation of Fiat as well as the demand for it so they're getting rid of their checking account which is likely insignificant compared to the amount of uh uh dollar denominated debt instruments essentially and so the treasury on its own is about 25 26 trillion dollars or so on or something like that and then you know other credit and debt instruments are um many dozens of trillions of dollars more so um if Bitcoin eats into that which you would expect it to because I don't think it's just going to continue to eat from pocket cash it's eating away you know if you look at ask what Bitcoin is doing you know they're diversifying not out of their uh Pocket Change not out of their checking account they're diversifying out of their savings account I mean uh to be fair a lot of it I'm sure would have stayed on checking accounts um but I think a lot of it as well is you know somebody like sailor which is uh ultimately we're talking about magnitudes you know he would have been holding government bonds this is what he would have been holding if he wasn't holding Bitcoin this is what he was usually holding before uh interest rates crashed so um in in this regard I think if you continue with a credit based system I I know I've gone on forever on this but I'm trying to summarize like a lot of chapters of the Fiat standard I may not be doing it justice so I'd urge you to pick it up and read it um but the summary of all of this is that Bitcoin more significantly than taking away the um uh demand four dollars it takes away the demand it takes away the supply creation mechanism of dollars by disincentivizing people from a um buying into debt in other words lending money out and um taking out loans and so you stop taking out a million loans as a bitcoiner and you start just living off of savings and I think this becomes more and more common and so therefore less Fiat debt is created and therefore you don't get a hyperinflationary situation in fact you get you know the continued uh what I would say is devaluation of Fiat because ultimately they're not going to get it they're not going to let it get Negative in terms of its Supply creation because governments are still going to take advantage of it and print money and hand out money to their cronies um but there's going to be a lot of money supply destruction I think um because of on the one hand what we mentioned earlier in terms of credit market failures but on the other hand if Bitcoin is rising and you know this is the premise here that we begin with if Bitcoin Rises then a lot of that demand for credit creation is going to go to buying Bitcoin and so therefore you just witness like with the computers and typewriters you witness an increase in the um size of the computer industry or computer-based money industry the Bitcoin and a slow ebbing away of value in the Fiat economy and eventually people get the hint and I think you know perhaps the kind of uh Rose tinted glasses uh way of looking at it is that as soon as you realize what is going on you know why get angry you just join Bitcoin and I think this is like as long as you're asleep and you're happy to play along and you believe your local uh Fiat overlords propaganda about inflation being transitory and uh um tiny then things are fine for you and you have no reason to get angry as soon as you figure out what's going on you could get angry or you could start stacking stats which is a much more productive use of your energies than the anger um and so therefore I think you know similarly like if you're in the typewriter industry like if you're an investor in typewriter industry and you get what's going on you're not going to go out there and destroy um apple and heal it back at an IBM you're going to invest in them and make money like it's just here's what's going on you get it so I think this is kind of my rosy scenario where how Bitcoin and Fiat uh coexist for a while and Bitcoin continues to rise and Fiat is you know slowly taken to its resting place of economic insignificance where you know less and less economically significant people continue to work in and for governments doing less and less consequential things over time and getting paid in less and less valuable uh little Fiat tokens and playing putting them in their casinos and slot machines of financial markets over time while all the grown-ups move on to real hard money but I should say that was great I still should say I still end the book by saying like this becomes less and less likely the more we are likely to see things like the uh settle back digital currencies because they just um make this a moot point because it's no longer about credit creation they're just going to print money and give everybody all the money that they that they deserve in which case fasten your seat belts all these Rosy scenarios um are not going to come good who knows we'll see   thank you
