    "Question": "What is the main problem with fiat currency?",
    "Answer": "The main problem with fiat currency is that it is subject to inflation, which erodes its purchasing power over time. This is because central banks can print more money, which increases the supply and reduces the value of each individual unit."

    "Question": "How does the Bitcoin network prevent double-spending?",
    "Answer": "The Bitcoin network prevents double-spending by using a distributed ledger called the blockchain.

    "Question": "What is the role of nodes in the Bitcoin network?",
    "Answer": "Nodes are computers that run the Bitcoin software and help to maintain the network. They validate transactions, relay them to other nodes, and help to secure the network by verifying the blockchain."

    "Question_ID": "8",
    "Question": "What is the significance of Bitcoin's decentralized nature?",
    "Answer": "Bitcoin's decentralized nature means that there is no central authority that controls the network. This makes it more resistant to censorship, hacking, and other forms of interference. It also means that users have more control over their own funds and can transact with anyone in the world without needing permission from a third party."
